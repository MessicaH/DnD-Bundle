            <p>In Dungeons & Dragons, Races (origins) represent the various humanoid species that inhabit the fantasy worlds of the game.
                These encompass a wide range of creatures, from classic fantasy races like Humans, Elves, Dwarves, and Halflings
                to more exotic options such as Dragonborn, Tieflings, and Gnomes. We will only be covering the core Races here per the 
                Player's Handbook.</p>
            <p>Each race comes with unique traits and Abilities, such as enhanced senses, magical abilities, or cultural
                characteristics, which influence a character's abilities, appearance, and status in the game's world.
                Players choose a race for their character during character creation. This choice often shapes their character's
                background and role within the party and the broader narrative of the campaign.</p>
