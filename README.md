# D&D Beginner's Bundle (_in progress_)
Combination of Week 9, 12, and final project concepts for Promineo Tech front-end course.

## Project Summary üìñ
- This started as an exploration of HTML and CSS styling for a basic webpage. We slowly added Bootstrap grid layouts and DOM Manipulation concepts to improve web styling consistencies. (Week 9-10)
- We then added on API calls and .json files for, say, a way for a DM (Dungeon Master) to manage their various playing groups and their special character attributes. (Week 12 and 15)
- The final project combined these all within the React-Router framework for easier iteration and manipulation for further updates.

### Programming Languages Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap
- React
### Helpful Generators for Content
- D&D Beyond
